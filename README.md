# Sample-Firebase-Login
A native android sample of implementing firebase login and signup. This sample project can be modified to suit your needs. I plan to maintain this project to help myself and others get a good place from where they can get a simple login and signup page for their android apps. Even if you do not use firebase, you can use the layouts in your project.

## Motivation
I am planning to create a series of small sample android apps which can then be used when building a larger app. This reduces the time needed to deal with minor tasks such as setting up login and sign up and allows to focus on more important tasks instead. This project is the first installment in that series!
